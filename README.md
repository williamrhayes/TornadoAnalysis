# TornadoAnalysis
Analyzing severe weather patterns using data visualization and maps, specifically interested in Arkansas


I live in an area of Arkansas that frequently experiences tornado warnings and I'd like to 
know where these tornadoes have gone before! For this project I want to retrieve historical tornado 
data, plot it on a map, and determine how at-risk a given building is for tornadoes.
